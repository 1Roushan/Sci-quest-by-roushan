  <h1>ðŸ§¬ DNA â€“ The Code of Life</h1>
  <p>DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) is the genetic blueprint of life. Found in almost every cell, it contains the instructions for growth, repair, and function.</p>
  <h3>Highlights:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>DNA is made of four bases: A, T, G, and C</li>
    <li>Each personâ€™s DNA is unique</li>
    <li>Itâ€™s passed from parents to children</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Without DNA, there is no life. That's why it's called the <em>code of life</em>.</p>
